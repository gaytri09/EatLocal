EatLocal

EatLocal is a web application designed to help users discover and enjoy local dishes from various parts of India. The app is simple to use and offers a convenient way for food lovers to explore the diverse culinary landscape of the country.

How It Works

When users first open the app, they start by selecting their current location. This step ensures that the app can provide recommendations for restaurants and dishes nearby, making it easy for users to find local specialties wherever they are.

Once the location is set, users can dive deeper into their culinary journey by selecting a specific state, such as Rajasthan, and choosing a popular local dish like Dal Bati Churma. This feature allows users to explore and appreciate the unique flavors and traditional dishes from different regions across India.

After choosing a dish, EatLocal lists popular restaurants in the selected area that serve the chosen specialty. The app provides detailed information about each restaurant, including the menu, customer reviews, and ratings. This makes it easy for users to decide where they would like to dine based on the quality and reputation of the restaurant.

Food Delivery Integration

To make the experience even more convenient, EatLocal integrates with well-known food delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy. This integration allows users to not only explore menus and read reviews but also place food orders directly through the app. Whether users prefer dining out, ordering takeout, or having food delivered to their doorstep, EatLocal streamlines the process, making it all accessible in one place.

Technology Stack

The frontend of EatLocal is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. The design is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to browse through options, filter their searches, and find the information they need with minimal effort. This makes EatLocal accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of comfort with technology.

Purpose

EatLocal aims to be more than just a food discovery app. It serves as a cultural guide, helping users explore and appreciate the rich culinary heritage of India. By offering a platform that brings together a wide variety of regional dishes and the best places to enjoy them, EatLocal encourages users to discover new flavors and enjoy the diverse food culture of India, all from the comfort of their own homes.
